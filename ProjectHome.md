A modern, C# Code rewrite of the original 1971 Star Trek game by Mike Mayfield, with additional features...  :)

(Well that's not true.. its a rewrite of a **rewrite** done by Michael Birken in 2008.  Here's that game: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28228/Star-Trek-1971-Text-Game )

**There's still some bugs to be worked out.. please be patient, (or make a bug report on the issues tab.. or download the code and find the bug yourself! :) )**

This is a labor of love, really, as there is no sane point to taking a very, very old piece of BASIC code, making it Object-Oriented, Unit-testable, and abstracting out all the concepts, other than the desire to see it in another code form, and to have all the features I wanted it to have back in 1986..

Latest:
<br>- Shooting Starbases has consequences (Hostile Federation ships will show up and totally change the dynamic of the game.)<br>
<br>- Damage control subsystem added.  Player can effect an emergency fix in the heat of battle<br>
<br>- Hostile ships will now taunt you.  new "tlm" command to translate Klingon taunts.<br>
<br>- Player will now automatically scavenge photons and energy from destroyed ship debris<br>
<br>- Shields now auto-raise when in combat area<br>
<br>- All ships now indicate their faction on their SRS indicator<br>
<br>- bugfix: Starbases should no longer show up in nebulae.<br>
<br>
<--------- See "Links" section for downloads..<br>
<br>
However, there is now both a debug mode and config file for the application so that users can tweak the experience, such as visuals, names of objects, ship settings, various balance points, etc..<br>

<hr />

Subsequent versions will have additional concepts that evolved during the abstraction of this conversion.<br>
<br>

<br>- Larger Galactic Map<br>
<br>- Larger Sectors<br>
<br>- Enemy ships will have subsystems, and those can be damaged<br>
